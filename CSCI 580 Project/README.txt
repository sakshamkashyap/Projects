Regrade request

In HW1, I forgot to convert the color values before writing them to the file ( 2 pts ) 

In HW3, I had a small typo in each of my rotate functions that caused the rotation to fail ( 3 pts )

I know I was supposed to submit this with HW4 ( didn't know at the time ) but included it here just in case
